# Building the Editor

Below are instructions to build the editor on either Linux or Windows.<br/>
Note that due to a small dependency on libdragon, GCC is required for now.<br/>
On Windows, that means building via MSYS2.

## Prerequisites

Before building the project, make sure you have the following tools installed:
- CMake
- Ninja
- GCC with at least C++23 support
- Git LFS

Linux users should follow the conventions of their distribution and package manager for all packages.

Windows users need to make sure a recent version of MSYS2 is installed (https://www.msys2.org/).<br>
Open an MSYS2 terminal in the `UCRT64` environment, and install the UCRT-specific packages for the dependencies:
```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja
```

### Git LFS

On some Linux distributions, Git LFS may require adding an external repository to your package manager per these [instructions](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/INSTALLING.md).

Windows users should already have Git LFS installed as part of Git for Windows. You can verify this by running:
```sh
git lfs version
```
If no version is shown, install Git LFS via the installer available on their website (https://git-lfs.com/).

After installing Git LFS, initialize it by running:
```sh
git lfs install
```
If you already cloned the `pyrite64` repository before initalizing Git LFS, navigate to the repository root folder and run:
```sh
git lfs update
```

## Build Instructions

After cloning the `pyrite64` repository, make sure to fetch all the submodules:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To configure the project, run:
```sh
cmake --preset <preset>
```

After that, and for every subsequent build, run:
```sh
cmake --build --preset <preset>
```

Where `<preset>` is replaced with the CMake preset name corresponding to your system:
- Linux:
	- `linux-release` (default optimized build)
	- `linux-debug` (debug symbols, no sanitizers)
	- `linux-asan` (debug + Address/UB sanitizers)
- Windows (MSYS2):
	- `windows-gcc-release`
	- `windows-gcc-debug`

Legacy aliases are still available:
- `linux` → `linux-release`
- `windows-gcc` → `windows-gcc-release`

Once the build is finished, a program called `pyrite64` (or `pyrite64.exe`) should be placed in the root directory of the repo.<br>
The program itself can be placed anywhere on the system, however the `./data` and `./n64` directories must stay next to it.

To open the editor, simply execute `./pyrite64` (or `.\pyrite64.exe`).
