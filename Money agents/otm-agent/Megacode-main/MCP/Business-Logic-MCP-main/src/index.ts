/**
 * Business Logic MCP Server
 * A single-file MCP server that exposes business rules, state machines,
 * field semantics, and known footguns to LLMs during code generation.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   # Using the installed CLI (recommended)
 *   npx business-logic-mcp
 *
 *   # From source with ts-node
 *   npx ts-node src/index.ts
 *
 *   # Or compile then run the built JS
 *   npx tsc && node dist/index.js
 *
 * Add to your MCP client config:
 *   { "command": "business-logic-mcp", "args": [] }
 *   # or, if pointing directly at the compiled file:
 *   { "command": "node", "args": ["path/to/dist/index.js"] }
